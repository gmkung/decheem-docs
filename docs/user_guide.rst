Getting started
------------------------------------
deCheem was designed to allow everyone to start sketching and testing ideas and rules within a few minutes.
If you need some help to get started, here are some instructions for you!

Creating a deCheem account
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#. To create an account, go to app.decheem.io and click on 'Sign Up'
#. Sign up either with your Google Account or create a fresh user name and password for deCheem.
#. Once done, you will be redirected to the working view, where you can start creating and testing your first rule systems.

Navigating deCheem
^^^^^^^^^^^
#. If it is your first time logging into deCheem, the first thing to do is to click on the big grey box on the left to create a new rule system.
#. deCheem is a tool for sketching and testing rule/belief systems, and the layout is meant to help you with this process.

    #. The basic building block in deCheem is simply a `basic English sentence <https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentence#Basic_English_sentences>`_, which - as a proposition - can be either **true** or **false** (toggle this by click on the 'invert' button on the rule.
    #. Sentences can then be used to build If-Then rules.
    #. A collection of rules form a rule system, which can then be explored, analysed and tested.
    
#. Sentences (describing a situation) can be entered directly as part of a rule or simply pinned at the side under 'Pinned sentences', until you figure out how to fit it into a rule.

    #. Note that sentences should read grammatically correct whether it is standalone (e.g. **The person is guilty**) or as part of a rule (e.g. If the evidence is found then *the person is guilty*)

#. Once you have at least one rule, you should see nodes appearing in the network graph on the right. This shows the **correlation** between various situations/ideas (aka sentences) and rules.
#. If you want to test and analyse the **causation** between various situations instead, select on 'Causation analysis' at the top-right instead.

    #. In this view, you can explore hypothetic situations described by any combination of sentences (true or false) mentioned in your rule system.
