deCheem belief style guide
==================================
Here you will find a number of best practices on how to phrase your beliefs in order to build the most scalable belief base possible. 

How do I construct a deCheem belief?
--------------------------------------------
Entering new deCheem beliefs is simple: you just need to phrase your beliefs in terms of 'situations', and use the words 'Always', 'Possibly' or 'Never' to add what the situation should or should not be.

Here are a few examples:

* **Regular speech**:
   * People who have diabetes should eat less sugar
* **deCheem belief**:
   * Situations in which **the person has diabetes** is **always** a situation where **the person should eat less sugar**.


* **Regular speech**:
   * If the climate is cold, people should not be trying to plant coconut trees
* **deCheem belief**:
   * A situations in which **the climate is cold** is **never** a situation where **the person should be trying to plant coconut trees**.


Write beliefs with clear and limited scopes
------------------------------------------------
deCheem analyses are most useful when generic beliefs can be used to derive very specific advice for very niche situations. 
In the deCheem world, general rules are derived from the exceptions. This means that the more specific and concise you write your beliefs, the more useful they become. Why is this so? Because the more specific the scope of a belief, the higher the chance that it will not over-generalise and end up making an incorrect generalisation about a certain kind of situation. 

Beliefs are also meant to be correct even read just by itself, so the only way to bring context into a short belief is to be specific.

A few guidelines:
**Narrow but Deep**
Use words like "the" and "in question" to narrow the scope of your belief, and refer to singular things instead of plural terms, as using the latter increases the chance of over-generalisations.

* A situation in which **people are unhappy** is **Always** a situation where **work is not good**.
..
  'People' and 'Work' are used in a way that's too generic here. 'Work' here could mean an artwork, labour of a person or the work in the physics sense. 
    
* A situation in which **the person is unhappy** is **Always** a situation where **the work of the person in question is not good**.
..
  By introducing 'the' and transforming plural to specific singular (e.g. 'people' to 'person'), the belief lends itself to being used in more situations without risk of generalisation.
