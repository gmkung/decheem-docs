deCheem belief style guide
==================================
Here you will find a number of best practices on how to phrase your beliefs in order to build the most scalable belief base possible. 

How do I construct a deCheem belief?
--------------------------------------------
Entering new deCheem beliefs is simple: you just need to phrase your beliefs in terms of 'situations', and use the words 'Always', 'Possibly' or 'Never' to add what the situation should or should not be.

Here are a few examples:

* **Regular speech**:
   * People who have diabetes should eat less sugar
* **deCheem belief**:
   * Situations in which **the person has diabetes** is **always** a situation where **the person should eat less sugar**.


* **Regular speech**:
   * If the climate is cold, people should not be trying to plant coconut trees
* **deCheem belief**:
   * A situations in which **the climate is cold** is **never** a situation where **the person should be trying to plant coconut trees**.


Write beliefs with clear and limited scopes
------------------------------------------------
deCheem analyses are most useful when generic beliefs can be used to derive very specific advice for very niche situations. 
In the deCheem world, general rules are derived from the exceptions. This means that the more specific and concise you write your beliefs, the more useful they become. Why is this so? Because the more specific the scope of a belief, the higher the chance that it will not over-generalise and end up making an incorrect generalisation about a certain kind of situation. 

Beliefs are also meant to be correct even read just by itself, so the only way to bring context into a short belief is to be specific.

A few guidelines:

**Make beliefs narrow but deep**

Use words like "the" and "in question" to narrow the scope of your belief, and refer to singular things instead of plural terms, as using the latter increases the chance of over-generalisations.

Sentence 1: A situation in which **people are unhappy** is **Always** a situation where **work is not good**.*

  'People' and 'Work' are used in a way that's too generic here. 'Work' here could mean an artwork, labour of a person or the work in the physics sense. 
    
Sentence 2: A situation in which **the person is unhappy** is **Always** a situation where **the work of the person is not good**.

  By introducing 'the' and transforming plural to specific singular (e.g. 'people' to 'person'), the belief lends itself to being used in more situations without risk of generalisation. However, which person am I talking about?

Sentence 3: A situation in which **the person in question is unhappy** is **Always** a situation where **the work of the person in question is not good**.

  Using the words "in question" to denote the person we are talking about this very moment, we distinguish it from the 'abstract person', allow us to introduce phrases like "the person in question is Bill Gates" in other beliefs that will help sharpen the identity of the person we are talking about. 



Distinguish between "clustered AND" and "independent AND"
----------------------------------------------------------
The following two beliefs sound similar, but actually can mean very different things:

  Situations in which **the cat is blue, furry** is **Always** a situation where **the cat is friendly**.
  
...versus...

  Situations in which **the cat is blue** and **the cat is furry** is **Always** a situation where **the cat is friendly**.

The first one implies that only when a cat is _both_ blue _and_ furry is it also friendly (meaning a cat that is only blue and not furry is not friendly).

The second one implies that when a cat is _either_ blue _or_ furry, it is also friendly.


Likewise, the same applies when 'and' is applied to the second part of the belief:

  Situations in which **the cat is red** is **Never** a situation where **the cat is friendly, cute**.
  
...versus...

  Situations in which **the cat is red** is **Never** a situation where **the cat is friendly** and **Never** a situation where **the cat is cute**.

The first one implies that when a cat is red, it is not friendly _only when_ it is also not cute, and not cute _only when_ it is not friendly. If the cat is red and cute, it could still be either friendly or not friendly.
The second one implies that when a cat is red, it will definitely be _neither_ cute _nor_ friendly.
