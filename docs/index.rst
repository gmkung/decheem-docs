Quick-start guide to deCheem
=======================

What is the deCheem Explorer?
-----------------------------
deCheem Explorer is a web-app that uses the deCheem framework to provide the most efficient way for managing beliefs, knowledge and argumentation.

By extending our human limitations to deduction and memory, it allows us to apply a same level logical rigor to philosophical, legal or social science reasoning that has previously only been seen in the field of computing, mathematics and science.


How do I use the deCheem Explorer?
-----------------------------
The first step of any deCheem exercise is to use the *Belief-base editor* to build the belief system you want to analyse. You do so by documenting beliefs about relationship between situations in the discussion that you are trying to work on. 

Once that's done, you can use the *Explorer* to explore the implications of such a belief system in various specific situations. Explores are designed to be *specific* and *independent*, allowing one to analyse very specific situations without worrying about any 'cross-contamination/confusion' between arguments and situation.

Take a look at this sample deCheem base to find out how deCheem dissects the classic debate around ??? and shows where exactly the disagreement is.
