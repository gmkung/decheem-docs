Quick-start guide to deCheem
=======================

What is the deCheem Explorer?
-----------------------------
The deCheem Explorer helps us achieve indisputable conclusions to the most twisted and complex discussions one can imagine.

By extending our human limitations to deduction and memory, it allows us to weaponise nebulous concepts in the realm of beliefs by using them to force consensus-by-logic.

1 belief mentioning 4 situations generates 16 different scenarios and hundred arguments.


How do I use the deCheem Explorer?
-----------------------------
The first step of any deCheem exercise is to use the *Belief-base editor* to build the belief system you want to analyse. You do so by documenting beliefs about relationship between situations in the discussion that you are trying to work on. 

Once that's done, you can use the *Explorer* to explore the implications of such a belief system in various specific situations. Explores are designed to be *specific* and *independent*, allowing one to analyse very specific situations without worrying about any 'cross-contamination/confusion' between arguments and situation.

Take a look at this sample deCheem base to find out how deCheem dissects the classic debate around ??? and shows where exactly the disagreement is.
